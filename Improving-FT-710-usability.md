# Improving the out-of-box FT-710 usability

## WIP (Work in Progress)

When I first got my radio, **of course** I didn't read the manual and I went to operate it immediately. Few nuisances showed up, and for some picky operators, this is how I addressed them.

## 1. Power Meter needle
Argh, that was a killer for me. Out-of-the factory, the meter comes configured as "average" power instead of "peak" power. That resulted in a lazy needle around 30ish Watts, seldom hitting the 50s, and never the 100W. How to fix it:

## 2. Frequency shift when exchanging between USB and LSB
When you switch between USB/LSB/AM/CW, you'll get a frequency shift of +- 800 Hz, and that's not super useful for me, as I have to re-tune

## Main VFO tuning step
You will find out that the VFO and Clarifier in SSB mode tunes in 20 Hz steps in "Fine" mode. Well, I like 10 Hz steps more.

## Secondary tuning dial step
Out of the box, for each step in the encoder it jumps 5 kHz in the frequency. And I also like 1 kHz more.

## 4. Mic gain, Compressor and AMG
